Brand Identity is the promise you are making your clients
joolies.com = a really fun branding for dates, cute and professional

foundation of brand identity
- purpose/ mission
- vision
- values
everlane.com/about = what does it tell you about their branding
   - clean, simple, not fun, transparency
make sure you can deliver on the promises your branding makes

brand  values: 
reliability
ease of use -> want making a site for them to be as easy as it can be for them

how to translate core values?
- visual design language - colors, font, images, etc
- tone of voice in writing
- content / conversations - response to comments, 
- policies & programs

 how does my brand come to life?
 - respond to questions from clients quickly (within 24 hours)
 - make it easy for them understand
 
 
 identify the things you are good at 
 identify the things you can do but shouldn't
 identify the things you can't do
 
 integrating brand identity into customer touchpoints
 - website, social media, email, calls, zoom
 - tone in emails (casual vs. formal)
 - bullet points (get to the point)
 - use a project management tool (asana) use email to communicate it was updated
 - or use an attachment google doc so they can work on it like a worksheet
 
 

for next week:
- settle on name !!important!!
- start brand identity kit for site/ brand style            
- get a sample site up, not the final site
 - think about how they interact with your brand in micro interactions
